## Sonic Playground Operating Guides

Welcome to the home of operating guides and technical manuals for select interactive exhibits featured in _*Sonic Playground*.  
The interactives represented here were designed by Bury, Hogan & Associates LLC, and Moldover/Happencraft in collaboration with [GRAMMY Museum](https://grammymuseum.org/) and [Curious Beast](https://www.curiousbeast.org).  

Use these operating guides to address system issues and unusual behaviors, and to understand the machine automation processes that run the interactives on a daily basis.

- See [Guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/) for all documents.
