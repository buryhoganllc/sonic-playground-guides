### LOOP STATION - Information and Troubleshooting Guide

The three (3) `LOOP STATION` activities use Apple iPads running the `LaunchPad` iPadOS application. All three stations have been curated with custom content from `SoundTrack Loops.`

To prevent the users from changing settings, we utilize the built-in `Guided Access` feature of iPadOS. This feature, found in `System Settings>Accessibility>General>Guided Access`, allows us to block off certain features of the iPad and application, including access to other sound banks, volume controls, filters, etc. Each of these functions has the ability to render the activity unresponsive.

### Troubleshooting

### Blank Screen

- verify that the USB-C power cable is connected to the iPad
- verify that the power supply (charging brick) is connected to power in the closet area behind the iPads
- verify that all connections on the power/breakout connector are seated and snug

### The Screen Layout is Incorrect

- `Guided Access` mode may have been disrupted. Verify that `Guided Access` is enabled.
  - If need be, turn off `Guided Access` and turn it back on following the steps below

### Resetting Guided Access Mode

- open the kiosk containing the iPad
- press the `HOME` button rapidly three (3) times. A numeric password screen appears.
- enter the iPad password
- Quit `Guided Access`
- Restart `Guided Access`, making sure that the proper screen area is blocked off:
  - rapidly press the `HOME` button three (3) times. The screen will display `Start` in the upper right corner.
  - Press `Start`
  - Draw a circle or square around the areas to block out. Refer to the image below:
